# Balanced Binary Search Tree

This project implements a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. The tree maintains balance to ensure optimal performance for insertion, deletion, and search operations. The project includes functions for building the tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, traversing the tree, and checking if the tree is balanced.

## Features

- **Node Class**: Represents each node in the BST.
- **Tree Class**: Represents the BST and includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversals.
- **Balanced Tree**: Ensures the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions.
- **Traversal Methods**: Supports in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals.
- **Pretty Print**: Visualizes the tree structure in the console.
